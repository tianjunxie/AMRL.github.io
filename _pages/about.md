Our goal is to conduct cutting-edge research on materials for energy applications ranging from catalysis, recycling, batteries, and other subject matters. We strive to empower research via simulations and experiments jointly.
We seek to use computational and experimental methods to garner fundamental knowledge of high-performance materials applicable to advance our energy goals.

Opportunities
======
Whether you are an experimentalist or a computationalist, we have collaborative opportunities for you.
We have openings at MS/PhD level in the program.
Link to the [MS programs](https://www.ncat.edu/coe/departments/cbbe/graduate-program/ms-chemical-engineering.php)

PhD programs have multiple focuses, such as [Applied Science and Technology] (https://www.ncat.edu/cost/departments/applied-engineering-technology/phd-applied-science-and-technology.php), [Computational Data Science and Engineering](https://www.ncat.edu/coe/departments/cdse/phd-program/index.php), etc.


Please reach out for applications and other inquiries.
